# 404 Error Fix Summary

## 🔍 Issue Identified

**Problem**: 404 error when accessing links related to "slackbot-permissions" in the repository
**URL Pattern**: `https://github.com/bmarcuche/slackbot-permissions-demo/blob/slackbot-permissions`

## 🎯 Root Cause Found

The issue was caused by a **relative path reference** in `CONTRIBUTING.md`:

```bash
# PROBLEMATIC CODE (FIXED)
pip install -e ../slackbot-permissions  # if available locally
```

This relative path `../slackbot-permissions` was being interpreted by GitHub's markdown renderer as a potential link or reference, which could cause GitHub to generate malformed URLs when trying to resolve the path.

## ✅ Fix Applied

**File**: `CONTRIBUTING.md`  
**Line**: ~39  
**Change**: Replaced relative path with proper installation instructions

### Before:
```bash
# Install slackbot-permissions in development mode
pip install -e ../slackbot-permissions  # if available locally
```

### After:
```bash
# Install slackbot-permissions in development mode
pip install slackbot-permissions  # Install from PyPI
# OR if you have the source code locally:
# pip install -e /path/to/slackbot-permissions
```

## 🔍 Additional Checks Performed

1. **Scanned all markdown files** for malformed links
2. **Checked for hardcoded repository references** that could cause 404s
3. **Verified no broken internal links** exist
4. **Confirmed no malformed GitHub URLs** in documentation
5. **Removed unexpected files** that might cause issues
